I am a Biology graduate currently completing a Master's in Applied Bioinformatics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. With a growing background in data analysis and bioinformatics pipelines, I have gained hands-on experience using Python, R, Bash, and high-performance computing environments to work with biological datasets (e.g., RNA-seq, genomic data). I am open to a variety of roles in the fields of computer validation, datascience, and bioinformatics. I bring strong analytical thinking, a structured and adaptable mindset, and astrong willingness to continuously learn and evolve within dynamic and interdisciplinary teams that bridgescience, data, and technology.
